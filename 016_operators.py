# @TASK: To be a great programmer you will have to become a great researcher.
# Let's get started:
#
# 1. Search the web for "Python operators", then...
# 2. Find and fill out the following list of operators.
#
# I've started it for you.

# Addition
added = 2 + 3
print(f"2 + 3 = {added}")

# Multiplication
multiplied = 2 * 3
print(f"2 * 3 = {multiplied}")

# Subtraction
subtracted = 2 - 3
print(f"2 - 3 = {subtracted}")

#Division
divided = 2 / 3
print(f"2 / 3 = {divided}")

#Modulus
modulus = 2 % 3
print(f"2 % 3 = {modulus}")

#Floor Division
floor_divided = 2 // 3
print(f"2 // 3 = {floor_divided}")

# == Exponentiation == Sometimes known as "2 to the power of 3"
exp = 2 ** 3
print(f"2 ** 3 = {exp}")

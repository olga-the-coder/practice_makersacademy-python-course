#added = 2 + 3

# Is this a statement? Yes!
#
# That statement uses the `=` operator to assign the result of the expression on
# the right (`2 + 3`) to the name on the left (`added`).
#
# It's called a statement because it changes the 'state' of the program.

my_favourite_number = 99

print(f"My favourite number is: {my_favourite_number}")
print("---")

# These names — `my_favourite_number` — are typically called 'variables'.

todays_day = 19
todays_day = 20

print(f"Today's day is: {todays_day}")
print("---")

# You'll see that the first `19` value is thrown away and replaced with the
# second `20` value.
